# Python-Books
My Learning Journey with Python Books

This is my overall handnote to help me find and pinpoint which context is needed when doing my project.
I contrived to make this note readable and helpful enough for any readers who accidently visit my github.

Learning Python from books is effective to understand the basic concepts of the particular subject.
I'm the person who can't completely remember what I read, so I counter it with writing.

I suggest you to try the code after you read the current subject.
And also to understand what the code is say. It's okay if u can't do the same code like the author do.
But at least you can understand what the purpose of the code , how it is work, and its design.

I'm glad if you found my notes is helpful.
Happy reading :)
